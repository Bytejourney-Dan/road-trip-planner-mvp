# Road Trip Planner MVP

## Overview

This is a web-based road trip planner application that leverages AI to create comprehensive travel itineraries. Users input their trip details (start/end locations, dates, travel preferences) and receive a fully mapped, day-by-day itinerary generated by ChatGPT. The application integrates Google Maps APIs to provide visual route mapping, geocoded locations, and detailed travel information.

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with React frontend, Express backend, and AI-powered trip planning capabilities. It's designed as a lightweight MVP focused on delivering automated trip planning with visual map integration.
